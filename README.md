# Takka
This project provides a command-line batch script `Run.bat` that offers a range of Windows system utilities, including Windows debloating, KMS activation, and additional PowerShell utilities. The menu-driven interface is designed to help users perform these tasks from a single, centralized script..<br/><br/>
</div>

## Quick Start
Requirements:
- Windows OS - Designed for Windows 10/11.
- PowerShell - Required for running certain commands within the script.
- 7-Zip - Necessary for the WinRAR Password Cracker functionality (located at C:\Program Files\7-Zip).




## Download
To download the latest stable release, please visit the [Releases](https://github.com/rhunk/SnapEnhance/releases) page.<br/>
You can also download the latest debug build from the [Actions](https://github.com/rhunk/SnapEnhance/actions) section.<br/>
We no longer offer official `LSPatch` binaries for obvious reasons. However, you're welcome to patch them yourself, as they should theoretically work without any issues.

> [!TIP]  
> Snapchat has locked many user accounts that used SnapEnhance or its related forks due to new detections. It's recommended to use Snapchat [v12.81.0.44](https://www.apkmirror.com/apk/snap-inc/snapchat/snapchat-12-81-0-44-release/) or earlier. Only use signed builds or builds you've modified yourself to avoid compromising the security of your account.

## FAQ
<details>
  <summary>How to report a bug?</summary>

  - Check that the bug has not already been reported in [Issues](https://github.com/rhunk/SnapEnhance/issues?q=).
  - Make sure the bug is not occurring when you use Snapchat without SnapEnhance.
  - Make sure you have logs before reporting (go to the SnapEnhance application -> click on the debug icon at the top right and then on the 3 vertical dots -> export logs).

<details>
  <summary>My Snapchat keeps crashing/doesn't want to open after installing</summary>

  - In some cases, because of Android's signature verification, you **must install Snapchat before SnapEnhance**, so that the two can communicate with each other.
  - You may use [LSPatch](https://github.com/LSPosed/LSPatch/forks) or [LSPosed](https://github.com/LSPosed/LSPosed/forks) forks to ensure compatibility with new Android versions, as original projects are no longer updated.

</details>

<details>

</details>

<details>
  <summary>My phone isn't rooted; how do I use this?</summary>
